# Zentry Clone

A clean clone of the Zentry landing experience — implemented as a learning project to practice React, component structure, responsive layout, and GSAP animations.  
This repo is my rebuild inspired by a YouTube tutorial; the purpose was to learn and reverse-engineer modern landing interactions and improve frontend skills.
